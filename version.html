            <h3>1. <i>To Room Nineteen</i> by Doris Lessing (1978)</h3>

            <div class="anglais">
                <p>One night in the bedroom, Matthew asked: "Susan, I don't want to interfere— don't think that, please— but are you sure you are well?"</p>
                <p>She was brushing her hair at the mirror. She made two more strokes on either side of her head, before she replied: 'Yes, dear, I am sure I am well."</p>
                <p>He was again lying on his back, his blond head on his hands, his elbows angled up and part concealing his face. He said: "Then Susan, I have to ask you this question, though you must understand, I'm not putting any sort of pressure on you.” (Susan heard the word "pressure" with dismay, because this was inevitable; of course she could not go on like this.) "Are things going to go on like this?"</p>
                <p>"Well," she said, going vague and bright and idiotic again, so as to escape: "Well, I don't see why not."</p>
                <p>He was jerking his elbows up and down, in annoyance or in pain, and, looking at him, she saw he had got thin, even gaunt; and restless angry movements were not what she remembered of him. He said: "Do you want a divorce, is that it?"</p>
                <p>At this, Susan only with the greatest difficulty stopped herself from laughing: she could hear the bright bubbling laughter she would have emitted, had she let herself.</p>
            </div>

            <img class="separation" src="Images/separation_articles.png">

            <div class="francais">
                <p>Un soir dans la chambre, Matthew demanda : “Susan, je ne veux pas me mêler de ce qui ne me regarde pas… ne crois pas cela, s’il te plaît… mais tu es sûre que tu vas bien?”</p>
                <p>Elle se brossait les cheveux face au miroir. Elle se donna encore deux coups de brosse d’un côté puis de l’autre, puis elle répondit : “Oui, chéri, je suis sûre que je vais bien.”</p>
                <p>Il était de nouveau allongé sur le dos, sa tête aux cheveux blonds reposait sur ses mains, les coudes en équerre lui cachant à moitié le visage. Il dit : “Dans ce cas Susan, je dois te poser cette question; mais tu dois comprendre ceci : je ne te mets pas la pression de quelque manière que ce soit.” (Susan entendit le mot “pression” avec consternation, parce qu’il était inévitable. Bien sûr qu’elle ne pouvait pas continuer ainsi.) “Est-ce que tout cela va continuer ainsi?</p>
                <p>– Eh bien, dit-elle en reprenant un air évasif, enjoué et niais, pour éluder la question. Eh bien, je ne vois pas pourquoi ce ne serait pas le cas.”</p>
                <p>Il agitait nerveusement les coudes de haut en bas sous l’effet de la contrariété ou du chagrin, et, en le regardant, elle remarqua qu’il était amaigri, et même émacié ; et elle ne se souvenait pas que la colère lui faisait faire des mouvements agités. Il dit : “Tu veux divorcer, c’est bien cela ?”</p>
                <p>A ces mots, ce ne fut qu’avec les plus grands efforts que Susan parvint à se retenir de rire : elle entendait le rire éclatant et pétillant qu’elle aurait émis, si elle ne l’avait pas retenu.</p>

            <h3>2. <i>The Horse Dealer’s Daughter</i> by D.H. Lawrence (1922)</h3>
        
            <div class="anglais">
                <p>And he hastened straight down, running over the wet, soddened fields, pushing through the hedges, down into the depression of callous wintry obscurity. It took him several minutes to come to the pond. He stood on the bank, breathing heavily. He could see nothing. His eyes seemed to penetrate the dead water. Yes, perhaps that was the dark shadow of her black clothing beneath the surface of the water.</p>
                <p>He slowly ventured into the pond. The bottom was deep, soft clay, he sank in, and the water clasped dead cold round his legs. As he stirred he could smell the cold, rotten clay that fouled up into the water. It was objectionable in his lungs. Still, repelled and yet not heeding, he moved deeper into the pond. The cold water rose over his thighs, over his loins, upon his abdomen. The lower part of his body was all sunk in the hideous cold element. And the bottom was so deeply soft and uncertain, he was afraid of pitching with his mouth underneath. He could not swim, and was afraid.</p>
                <p>He crouched a little, spreading his hands under the water and moving them round, trying to feel for her. The dead cold pond swayed upon his chest. He moved again, a little deeper, and again, with his hands underneath, he felt all around under the water. And he touched her clothing. But it evaded his fingers. He made a desperate effort to grasp it.</p>
                <p>And so doing his lost his balance and went under, horribly, suffocating in the foul earthy water, struggling madly for a few moments. At last, after what seemed an eternity, he got his footing, rose again into the air and looked around. He gasped, and knew he was in the world. Then he looked at the water. She had risen near him. He grasped her clothing, and drawing her nearer, turned to take his way to land again.</p>
            </div>

            <img class="separation" src="Images/separation_articles.png">
        
            <div class="francais">
                <p>Alors il s’empressa de descendre, courant droit devant à travers la pluie et les prés détrempés, traversant les haies, s’enfonçant ainsi dans la dépression de l’hiver cruel et obscur. Plusieurs minutes s’écoulèrent avant qu’il n’atteignât l’étang. Il s’immobilisa  sur la rive, hors d’haleine. Il ne voyait rien. Ses yeux semblaient pénétrer l’eau inerte. Oui, peut-être était-ce l’ombre opaque de ses habits noirs qu’on voyait sous la surface de l’eau.</p>
                <p>Il s’aventura lentement dans l’étang. Celui-ci, dont le fond était constitué d’une argile molle, était profond ; il s’enfonça dedans, et l’eau terriblement froide saisit ses jambes toutes entières. Alors qu’il bougeait doucement, il sentit l’argile froide et pourrie qui, en remontant, souillait l’eau. L’odeur était désagréable dans ses poumons. Il était écoeuré mais n’y prêta pas attention et avança malgré tout plus profondément dans l’étang. L’eau froide monta sur ses cuisses, sur ses reins, sur son abdomen. Toute la partie inférieure de son corps était immergée dans l’élément froid et horrible. Et le fond de l’étang était si mou et profondément incertain qu’il avait peur de glisser et de se retrouver bouche sous l’eau. Il ne savait pas nager et il avait peur.</p>
                <p>Il fléchit légèrement les genoux, tendant les mains sous l’eau et décrivant des cercles avec, dans une tentative de tâtonner pour la trouver. L’eau terriblement froide de l’étang clapotait contre sa poitrine. Il avança encore un peu plus loin, puis encore plus, les mains plongées dans l’eau ; il cherchait à tâtons tout autour de lui sous l’eau. Et il toucha ses habits. Mais ils lui filèrent entre les doigts. Il fit un effort désespéré pour les agripper.</p>
                <p>Et ce faisant, il perdit l’équilibre et sombra, horriblement, suffoquant dans l’eau infâme et terreuse, luttant frénétiquement pendant quelques instants. Enfin, après ce qui parut une éternité, il reprit pied, s’éleva de nouveau hors de l’eau et regarda autour de lui. Il prit une grande bouffée d’air, et sut qu’il était en vie. Puis il regarda l’eau. Elle était remontée près de lui. Il agrippa ses habits et, l'attirant plus près, il se retourna pour revenir à la terre ferme.</p>

            <h3>3. <i>A Star Called Henry</i> by Roddy Doyle (1999)</h3>
        
            <div class="anglais">
                <p>I had to blink; the sweat stung my eyes. My trigger finger was aching, my calves, the elbow that anchored the arm propping up my rifle; every muscle and sinew I owned was hardening, screaming. A hint, the slightest thing or sound would save them and release all the anger and rage I’d been storing for today. I wanted to demolish every bit of glass and brick in front of me. The creak of stretched leather, a boot on a kerb, the sun on a badge, any tiny thing would let me go.</p>
                <p>But the world out there was absolutely still. Absolutely nothing. And in here, around me. Nothing at all. From upstairs or anywhere. We hadn’t a hope. We were waiting for the world to drop on us.</p>
                <p>Then we heard a laughter, and more joining it. From outside. Over at the pillar.</p>
                <p>–I was only havin’ yis on!</p>
                <p>I kept my gun on Tyler’s but I looked at the gobshite who’d stepped onto the street in front of us. With his butties coming after him. A thick-looking eejit with a cap jammed down on his head.</p>
                <p>There were explosions of breath throughout the building, shouts of fury and disappointment.</p>
                <p>–Let me up there till I shoot the fucker!</p>
                <p>It was very, very tempting. He was standing right in front of us, with the grin dripping off him.</p>
                <p>	–Yis didn’t panic, anyway, he shouted. –Fair play to yis.</p>
                <p>–Permission to kill him, sir.</p>
                <p>–Denied, said Connolly as he got down from the barricade after gawking out at the gobshite who’d set the Republic wobbling. –We can’t spare the bullet.</p>
                <p>Then something in the street. A grenade. One of our homemade ones. One of the lads on the roof had dropped it. A can full of metal chunks and a generous knob of gelignite. It landed with a dull, threatening thunk, in front of the gobshite and his pals. They saw the fuse sticking out of it and they scattered and disappeared behind Nelson. The unlit fuse. And we heard Ned Mannix’s voice from upstairs.</p>
                <p>–Yis didn’t panic, anyway!</p>
                <p>Connolly was furious. His face raced beyond purple. He spat and stamped his foot. He roared at the ceiling.</p>
                <p>–Mannix!</p>
                <p>He roared at us all.</p>
                <p>–You thicks! You bloody eejits! They might be out there to distract us!</p>
                <p>I looked out again. Connolly was right; I expected to see tight rows of advancing troops, covering, swallowing the street, already scaling the barricades, in on top of us. What I saw was the gobshite.</p>
                <p>–You’re in right trouble now! he roared.</p>
                <p>He stood well away from the grenade.</p>
                <p>–There’s worse than the military coming now! he roared.</p>
                <p>Connolly had calmed down.</p>
                <p>–Retrieve that grenade, someone, before one of those gutties outside decides to throw it back at us.</p>
                <p>The main door was opened – the gobshite ran again – and Frank Lawless dashed out and grabbed the grenade. He was on his way back when the women arrived.</p>

Le doigt posé sur la gâchette me faisait mal, mes mollets aussi, et le coude qui maintenait solidement en place le bras avec lequel j’épaulais*1 mon fusil ; chaque muscle et chaque tendon de mon corps se contractait, hurlait. Un signe, la moindre chose ou le moindre bruit les sauverait et laisserait sortir toute la colère et la rage que j’avais emmagasiné pour aujourd’hui. J’avais envie de démolir chaque morceau de verre et de brique qui se trouvait devant moi.</p>

            <h3>4. <i>The Great Gatsby</i> by F. Scott Fitzgerald (1925)</h3>
        
            <div class="anglais">
                <p>The first supper – there would be another after midnight – was now being served, and Jordan invited me to join her own party who were spread around a table on the other side of the garden. There were three married couples and Jordan’s escort, a persistent undergraduate given to violent innuendo and obviously under the impression that sooner or later Jordan was going to yield him up her person to a greater or lesser degree. Instead of rambling this party had preserved a dignified homogeneity, and assumed to itself the function of representing the staid nobility of the countryside – East Egg condescending to West Egg, and carefully on guard against its spectroscopic gayety.</p>
                <p>“Let’s get out,” whispered Jordan, after a somehow wasteful and inappropriate half hour. “This is much too polite for me.”</p>
                <p>We got up, and she explained that we were going to find the host – I had never met him, she said, and it was making me uneasy. The undergraduate nodded in a cynical, melancholy way.</p>
                <p>The bar, where we glanced first, was crowded but Gatsby was not there. She couldn’t find him from the top of the steps, and he wasn’t on the veranda. On a chance we tried an important-looking door, and walked into a high Gothic library, panelled with carved English oak, and probably transported complete from some ruin overseas.</p>
                <p>A stout, middle-aged man with enormous owl-eyed spectacles was sitting somewhat drunk on the edge of a great table, staring with unsteady concentration at the shelves of books. As we entered he wheeled excitedly around and examined Jordan from head to foot.</p>
                <p>“What do you think?” he demanded impetuously.</p>
                <p>“About what?”</p>
                <p>He waved his hand toward the book-shelves.</p>
                <p>“About that. As a matter of fact you needn’t bother to ascertain. I ascertained. They’re real.”</p>
                <p>“The books?”</p>
                <p>He nodded.</p>
                <p>“Absolutely real–have pages and everything. I thought they’d be a nice durable cardboard. Matter of fact, they’re absolutely real. Pages and – Here! Lemme show you.”</p>
                <p>Taking our skepticism for granted, he rushed to the bookcases and returned with Volume One of the “Stoddard Lectures.”</p>
                <p>“See!” he cried triumphantly. “It’s a bona fide piece of printed matter. It fooled me. This fella’s a regular Belasco. It’s a triumph. What thoroughness! What realism! Knew when to stop too – didn’t cut the pages. But what do you want? What do you expect?”</p>
                <p>He snatched the book from me and replaced it hastily on its shelf muttering that if one brick was removed the whole library was liable to collapse.</p>
                <p>"Who brought you?" he demanded. "Or did you just come? I was brought. Most people were brought."</p>
                <p>Jordan looked at him alertly, cheerfully without answering.</p>
                <p>"I was brought by a woman named Roosevelt," he continued. "Mrs. Claud Roosevelt. Do you know her? I met her somewhere last night. I've been drunk for about a week now, and I thought it might sober me up to sit in a library."</p>
                <p>"Has it?"</p>
                <p>"A little bit, I think. I can't tell yet. I've only been here an hour. Did I tell you about the books? They're real. They're– –"</p>
                <p>"You told us."</p>
                <p>We shook hands with him gravely and went back outdoors.</p>
                <p>There was dancing now on the canvas in the garden, old men pushing young girls backward in eternal graceless circles, superior couples holding each other tortuously, fashionably, and keeping in the corners–and a great number of single girls dancing individualistically or relieving the orchestra for a moment of the burden of the banjo or the traps. By midnight the hilarity had increased. A celebrated tenor had sung in Italian and a notorious contralto had sung in jazz and between the numbers people were doing "stunts" all over the garden, while happy vacuous bursts of laughter rose toward the summer sky. A pair of stage "twins"-who turned out to be the girls in yellow-did a baby act in costume and champagne was served in glasses bigger than finger bowls. The moon had risen higher, and floating in the Sound was a triangle of silver scales, trembling a little to the stiff, tinny drip of the banjoes on the lawn.</p>
                <p>I was still with Jordan Baker. We were sitting at a table with a man of about my age and a rowdy little girl who gave way upon the slightest provocation to uncontrollable laughter. I was enjoying myself now. I had taken two finger bowls of champagne and the scene had changed before my eyes into something significant, elemental and profound.</p>
                <p>At a lull in the entertainment the man looked at me and smiled.</p>
                <p>"Your face is familiar," he said, politely. "Weren't you in the Third Division during the war?"</p>
                <p>"Why, yes. I was in the Ninth Machine-Gun Battalion."</p>
                <p>"I was in the Seventh Infantry until June nineteen-eighteen. I knew I'd seen you somewhere before."</p>
                <p>We talked for a moment about some wet, grey little villages in France. Evidently he lived in this vicinity for he told me that he had just bought a hydroplane and was going to try it out in the morning.</p>
                <p>"Want to go with me, old sport? Just near the shore along the Sound."</p>
                <p>"What time?"</p>
                <p>"Any time that suits you best."</p>
                <p>It was on the tip of my tongue to ask his name when Jordan looked around and smiled.</p>
                <p>"Having a gay time now?" she inquired.</p>
                <p>"Much better." I turned again to my new acquaintance. "This is an unusual party for me. I haven't even seen the host. I live over there–" I waved my hand at the invisible hedge in the distance, “and this man Gatsby sent over his chauffeur with an invitation.”</p>
                <p>For a moment he looked at me as if he failed to understand.</p>
                <p>“I’m Gatsby,” he said suddenly.</p>
                <p>“What!” I exclaimed. “Oh, I beg your pardon.”</p>
                <p>“I thought you knew, old sport. I’m afraid I’m not a very good host.”</p>
                <p>He smiled understandingly – much more than understandingly. It was one of those rare smiles with a quality of eternal reassurance in it, that you may come across four or five times in life. It faced – or seemed to face – the whole external world for an instant, and then concentrated on you with an irresistible prejudice in your favor. It understood you just so far as you wanted to be understood, believed in you as you would like to believe in yourself and assured you that it had precisely the impression of you that, at your best, you hoped to convey. Precisely at that point it vanished – and I was looking at an elegant young rough-neck, a year or two over thirty, whose elaborate formality of speech just missed being absurd. Some time before he introduced himself I’d got a strong impression that he was picking his words with care.</p>
                <p>Almost at the moment when Mr. Gatsby identified himself a butler hurried toward him with the information that Chicago was calling him on the wire. He excused himself with a small bow that included each of us in turn.</p>
                <p>“If you want anything just ask for it, old sport,” he urged me. “Excuse me. I will rejoin you later.”</p>
                <p>When he was gone I turned immediately to Jordan – constrained to assure her of my surprise. I had expected that Mr. Gatsby would be a florid and corpulent person in his middle years.</p>
                <p>“Who is he?” I demanded. “Do you know?”</p>
                <p>“He’s just a man named Gatsby.”</p>
                <p>“Where is he from, I mean? And what does he do?”</p>
                <p>“Now you’re started on the subject,” she answered with a wan smile. “Well, –he told me once he was an Oxford man.”</p>
                <p>A dim background started to take shape behind him but at her next remark it faded away.</p>
                <p>“However, I don’t believe it.”</p>
                <p>“Why not?”</p>
                <p>“I don’t know,” she insisted, “I just don’t think he went there.”</p>
                <p>Something in her tone reminded me of the other girl’s “I think he killed a man,” and had the effect of stimulating my curiosity. I would have accepted without question the information that Gatsby sprang from the swamps of Louisiana or from the lower East Side of New York. That was comprehensible. But young men didn’t – at least in my provincial inexperience I believed they didn’t – drift coolly out of nowhere and buy a palace on Long Island Sound.</p>
                <p>“Anyhow he gives large parties,” said Jordan, changing the subject with an urbane distaste for the concrete. “And I like large parties. They’re so intimate. At small parties there isn’t any privacy.”</p>
            </div>

                <p>Le premier souper – je dis « premier » car il y en aurait un autre après minuit – était en train d’être servi, et Jordan m’invita à me joindre à son groupe, qui était réparti autour d’une table à l’autre bout du jardin. En plus de trois couples mariés, on comptait parmi ses membres le cavalier de Jordan, un étudiant de premier cycle obstiné qui avait un penchant pour les allusions agressives et qui croyait de toute évidence que Jordan allait tôt ou tard céder et se donner à lui à un degré plus ou moins élevé. Cette fête n’avait pas l’air d’un pêle-mêle d’invités : elle avait en fait conservé une homogénéité pleine de dignité, et s’était attribué la charge de représenter la sage noblesse de la campagne : c’était East Egg qui dédaignait West Egg, restant prudemment sur ses gardes face à sa gaieté spectroscopique.</p>
